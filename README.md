# Pattern Printing Program

This C++ program is designed to generate a wide variety of patterns using the `PatternPrinter` class. It includes 30 different pattern methods, ranging from basic shapes to advanced designs, providing a comprehensive tool for visual pattern generation.

## Features

### Basic Patterns (1-10)
1. **Basic Rectangle Pattern**: A simple filled rectangle.
2. **Hollow Rectangle Pattern**: A rectangle with a hollow center.
3. **Right Triangle**: A right-angled triangle.
4. **Inverted Right Triangle**: An upside-down right-angled triangle.
5. **Mirrored Right Triangle**: A right triangle mirrored along the vertical axis.
6. **Number Triangle**: A triangle with increasing numbers.
7. **Inverted Number Triangle**: A triangle with decreasing numbers.
8. **Binary Triangle**: A triangle with alternating 0s and 1s.
9. **Character Triangle**: A triangle with increasing characters.
10. **Reverse Character Triangle**: A triangle with decreasing characters.

### Intermediate Patterns (11-15)
11. **Pyramid Pattern**: A centered pyramid of stars.
12. **Inverted Pyramid Pattern**: An upside-down pyramid.
13. **Diamond Pattern**: A diamond shape made of stars.
14. **Hollow Diamond Pattern**: A diamond with a hollow center.
15. **Butterfly Pattern**: A pattern resembling a butterfly.

### Advanced Number Patterns (16-20)
16. **Floyd's Triangle**: A triangle with sequential numbers.
17. **Pascal's Triangle**: A triangle representing binomial coefficients.
18. **Number Diamond**: A diamond shape with numbers.
19. **Fibonacci Pattern**: A pattern using Fibonacci numbers.
20. **Alternating Number Pattern**: A pattern with alternating numbers.

### Advanced Character Patterns (21-23)
21. **Character Diamond**: A diamond shape with characters.
22. **Spiral Character Pattern**: A spiral filled with characters.
23. **Character Wave**: A wave pattern using characters.

### Geometric Patterns (24-25)
24. **Arrow Pattern**: An arrow shape.
25. **Double Arrow Pattern**: Two arrows pointing in opposite directions.

### Special Patterns (26-30)
26. **Heart Pattern**: A heart shape made of stars.
27. **Clock Pattern**: A pattern resembling a clock face.
28. **Diagonal Pattern**: A pattern with diagonal lines.
29. **Spiral Number Pattern**: A spiral filled with numbers.
30. **Wave Pattern**: A wave-like pattern.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the source code.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o pattern_printer
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program.
   ```bash
   ./pattern_printer
   ```

3. **Select a Pattern**: Follow the on-screen menu to choose a pattern by entering its corresponding number.

4. **Specify Size**: Enter the desired size for the pattern when prompted.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Standard C++ libraries
